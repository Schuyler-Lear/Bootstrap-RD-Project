                        <p class="lead">I love anime, but the often slower pacing and requirement of your full attention often made it hard for me to watch the stories I was invested in. Especially as someone with ADHD, being able to read manga from my phone has made it tremendously easier, not to mention faster! Whether it's waiting before class, sitting on the bus, or even just while something's in the microwave, it's never not a good time to pull out your phone and read a quick chapter. For those interested in making the switch, here's a few things to know:</p>
                        <ul class="bullet">
                            <li>All manga on this list can be found on the Shonen Jump app! For just $2 a month, you can get unlimited access to these and many more, as well as new chapters as soon as they're out!</li>
                            <li>Most of these manga fall in the action/adventure genres!</li>
                            <li>Some of them do contain more mature and darker themes, which will be noted and displayed.</li>
                            <li>These are my opinions! If you dn't eel the same way about a certain story, that's ok! There are hundreds to choose from, and chances are you'll find something for you.</li>

                        <p class="lead">Wealth, fame, power. One Piece, by Eichiro Oda, is about a pirate, Monkey D. Luffy, and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, as they traverse the Grand Line in search of the pirate king's treasure. Its 1000+ chapters are full of some of the most unique, funny, and moving characters I've ever read. It may seem like a long read, but I've yet to meet a reader that hasn't said it's not long enough. </p>
